# Introduction
## Goal of this work

* Establish a workflow for `data.frame`.
* Discuss some ambiguities and practice the tools intrduced in this class.
* Learn to import data and using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to do some description and visualization.

## Bring rectangular data in

Dataset for this homework is `gapminder`.
*Storing `a = gapminder` for convenience* 


```r
library(gapminder)
a = gapminder #name "gapminder" as "a" for convenience
```

Packages will be used: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2` and `gridExtra`


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra) #a package to arrange multigraph
```


# Data structure
I will explore some basic objects of our dataset(`gapminder`): structue ,size and type of variables.  

## Is it a *data.frame*, *matrix*, *vector* or *list*?

Command `typeof`, `class` and `mode` will be compared in this section:


```r
typeof(a)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```

```r
class(a)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
```

```r
mode(a)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```

Obviously, outputs of those 3 commands are different, even based on the same object `gapminder`. As discussed in class03, `typeof` discribes a more basic data structure like "double", "integer", while `class` and `mode`discribe a more general data structure like "numeric", "charactor".

Attached is the official description for `typeof`,`mode` and `class`:

1. `typeof`
> typeof determines the (R internal) type or storage mode of any object.

2. `mode`
> Get or set the type or storage mode of an object.

3. `class`
> R possesses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for an object-oriented style of programming. Method dispatch takes place based on the class of the first argument to the generic function.

* `typeof` only privides the type of objects **internal** to R.
* `typeof` vs `mode`:Very similar, except for a few differences, most notably that both (typeof "integer" and "double") = (mode "numeric"); and both (typeof "special" and "builtin" = (mode "function").
* `class` is based on R's object-oriented class hierarchy, which laid out like the following graph:
![class hierarchy](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bJR8r.png)

There is a website disscussing [Concepts and dofference between typeof class mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35445112/what-is-the-difference-between-mode-and-class-in-r)

Solution: `gapminder` is a dataframe and the reason for showing 3 values by `class` is `tbl_df` is inherited from `tbl` which is inheried from `data.frame`.


## What is its class

Based on the output shown in last section, the class of `gapminder` is `tbl_df`.

## Size of `gapminder`

There are many ways to get the size of the data, `dim` and `ncol`,`nrow` are used here.


```r
dim(a) # show the number of rows and cols
```

```
## [1] 1704    6
```

```r
c(nrow(a), ncol(a)) # ncol= number of col/nrow= number of rows
```

```
## [1] 1704    6
```

## What data type is each variable?

`str` `glimpse` can be used to show more comprehensive data structure. 


```r
str(a)
```

```
## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
##  $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
##  $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
##  $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...

```

```r

```

```

*`str` can also show the class of the dataset.*

Based on the outputs, we have:

| **Variables**| **data type**|
|----------|-----------|
|`country`| Factor|
|`continent`| Factor|
|`year`| int|
|`lifeExp`|num|
|`pop`|int|

There is another frequently used function `summary`, which is used to show some general statistical fewture of dataset.


```r
summary(a)
```

```
##         country        continent        year         lifeExp     
##  Afghanistan:  12   Africa  :624   Min.   :1952   Min.   :23.60  
##  Albania    :  12   Americas:300   1st Qu.:1966   1st Qu.:48.20  
##  Algeria    :  12   Asia    :396   Median :1980   Median :60.71  
##  Angola     :  12   Europe  :360   Mean   :1980   Mean   :59.47  
##  Argentina  :  12   Oceania : 24   3rd Qu.:1993   3rd Qu.:70.85  
##  Australia  :  12                  Max.   :2007   Max.   :82.60  
##  (Other)    :1632                                                
##       pop              gdpPercap       
##  Min.   :6.001e+04   Min.   :   241.2

##  3rd Qu.:1.959e+07   3rd Qu.:  9325.5  
##  Max.   :1.319e+09   Max.   :113523.1  
## 
```

For factor variables, we can see the number of data in each catogory; for numeric variables, we can see some basic numeric property.

# Explore individual variables

In this section, I will choose some catogorical variables and quantitive variables from `gapminder` to explore. From last section, we already know that there are 2 categorical variables `country` and `continent` in the dataset, except for which are numerical.


## Explore catogorical variable: `continent`

First of all, selecting `continent` from `gapminder` and using `table` funciton to get build a contigency table of continent data.

*Storing continent as con for convenience*

```r
#store continent as con for convenience
con = select(a, continent) 
table(con)
```

```
## con
##   Africa Americas     Asia   Europe  Oceania 
##      624      300      396      360       24
```

```r
#summay is also usful to see some basic info of catogorical data
summary(con)
```

```
##     continent  
##  Africa  :624  
##  Americas:300  
##  Asia    :396  
##  Europe  :360  
##  Oceania : 24
```

We can see that there are 5levels under `continent`.


```r
#using barplot to visualize the data
p1 = barplot(table(con))
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# we can also use ggplot2 package to see the bar plot
ggplot(con,aes(continent)) +
  geom_bar(fill="cornflowerblue",color="black") + #bar plot
  labs(title="Continent data", x="continent",y="numbers") 
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png)<!-- -->

```r
# Moover, we can change the y-axis to the proportion
 #add y=..count../sum(..count..) aesthetic
ggplot(con,aes(continent,..count../sum(..count..))) +
  geom_bar() + #bar plot
  labs(title="Continent data", x="continent",y="proportion") +
  theme_gray()
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-3.png)<!-- -->

Now we clearly see the level and the distribution of `continent`, lets head up to quantitive data.


## Explore the quantitive data:`lifeExp` 

Firstly, I will select those two variables and to see some summary statistics such as quantiles and ranges.


```r
a %>% 
  select(lifeExp) %>% 
  summary() %>% 
knitr::kable() # create table
```

        lifeExp    
---  --------------
     Min.   :23.60 
     1st Qu.:48.20 
     Median :60.71 
     Mean   :59.47 
     3rd Qu.:70.85 
     Max.   :82.60 

Then, to reach more information about the variable, I will choose a histogram combined with a kernal density plot to show the distribution of data.


```r
ggplot(gapminder,aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), alpha=0.8,binwidth = 5) +
  geom_density(bw=2)
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

From the output, we can see the peak occures around 70.

Now we want to see the normality of `lifeExp`, using `qqplot`

```r
qqnorm(gapminder$lifeExp, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->



# Explore various plot type

## Explore data with groups

In this section, we are going to see how to using `ggplot` to explore data by group. Obviously, life expectancy is highly rekated to country and continent. Therefore, I addressed series of boxplot under different countries and group theme by continent.



```r
ggplot(gapminder,aes(country,lifeExp,color=continent,shape=continent))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(continent~.)
```

![](hw02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that it is not sensible to assume `lifeExp` is normal. Actually, it is quite reasonable, since there will be some reginal variation.





In Europe, the life expectancy in each country is pretty high and is consistent, while the data of Asia showed huge variation between countries. Generally speaking, Europe and Oceania have high life expectancy of their citizens and the spread of the life time is more concentrated, based on samller IQR.

Looking at other 3 continent, there are huge regianl variations and people's life expectancy are more widely spread.
